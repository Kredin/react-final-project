This is a stock dashboard. You submit ur transactions and it will save a list of your transactions and show your current positions based on the transactions given.

This was only made as a project for School as it is now it has no realworld application unfortunatly. most apps and sites that you buy stocks already have this built in.

All the heart of this project is really located in the Add Transactions section.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
